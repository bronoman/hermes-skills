# Bitcoin L1 Blockchain Skill for Hermes Agent

## What is Bitcoin

**Bitcoin** is "digital money" — a way to store and send value without a bank or government. Instead of trusting a company to hold your money, Bitcoin uses mathematics (cryptography) to prove ownership. You generate a unique key pair (like a username + super-secure password combined), and whoever holds the private key owns the Bitcoin.

**Why Bitcoin?** It's the hardest money ever created because:
- Supply is capped at 21 million coins (no government can print more)
- No bank can freeze your account or reverse transactions
- Transactions are permanent and transparent (recorded forever on the blockchain)
- You are your own bank (no middle man, no fees, no gatekeepers)

**How Bitcoin works:**
- You own a private key (secret, like a password)
- You derive a public address from that key (like your bank account number)
- Anyone can send Bitcoin to your address
- Only the private key holder can spend it
- Miners verify transactions and secure the network

**Why on-chain data matters:** Bitcoin's price, network fees, and transaction flow tell you what the market thinks and how the network is operating right now. Hermes tracks this via live Mempool data so your applications always have current blockchain context.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

**Will NOT provide trading advice**
- ❌ This is a data fetcher, not a price prediction tool
- ❌ AI cannot predict markets reliably
- ❌ Use price data for context, not investment decisions

**Will NOT execute transactions**
- ❌ Cannot send, receive, or move Bitcoin
- ❌ Cannot access wallets or private keys
- ❌ Read-only blockchain query only

**Will NOT predict fees or times**
- ❌ Fee estimates are probabilistic based on current mempool
- ❌ Actual confirmation times vary with network congestion
- ❌ Use estimates as guidance, not guarantees

**Will NOT give financial advice**
- ❌ This skill provides data only, not recommendations
- ❌ Always do your own research before transacting
- ❌ Consult a financial advisor for investment decisions

**Will NOT guarantee real-time data**
- ❌ Mempool.space updates every 10 seconds
- ❌ Block data lags by 1-2 seconds
- ❌ Prices cached and updated frequently but not tick-by-tick

## Quick Start

### Installation

From Hermes:
```bash
hermes skills install github.com/bronoman/hermes-skills bitcoin

cd ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/bitcoin
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py stats
```

### 7 Commands

**1. Get Address Balance & UTXOs**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py address <bitcoin_address> [--limit 20]
```
Example:
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py address 1A1z7agoat3bLsCywJ6H7qqyiB8t6SE2Kt
```

**2. Inspect Transaction**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py tx <txid>
```
Example:
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py tx abc123def456...
```

**3. Get Fee Estimates**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py fees [--currency USD]
```
Returns: sat/vB rates for 1m, 10m, 24h targets

**4. Mempool Analysis**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py mempool
```
Returns: pending tx count, pool size, fee distribution

**5. Recent Blocks**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py blocks [--limit 10]
```
Returns: latest blocks with timestamps and tx counts

**6. Network Stats**
```bash
python3 scripts/bitcoin_client.py stats
```
Returns: block height, mempool size, fees, BTC price

**7. BTC Price**

**CoinGecko (Optional)**
- Free API for BTC/USD pricing
- Optional API key for higher limits
- Falls back to Mempool prices if unavailable

**No External Dependencies**
- Uses Python stdlib only (urllib, json, argparse, datetime)

## Common Questions

### Q: Is this secure? Can Hermes be hacked and leak my Bitcoin?

**A:** No. This skill is **read-only** — it can only fetch blockchain data, not move coins. Your actual Bitcoin lives in a wallet (which you control via a private key). This skill has no access to wallets, exchanges, or your actual funds.

Think of it like checking public stock prices on Yahoo Finance — you're viewing data, not accessing your brokerage account.

### Q: Why no API key needed?

**A:** Mempool.space provides free public blockchain data. All Bitcoin transactions are public by design. This skill just queries that public data. No authentication needed.

### Q: Can this predict Bitcoin price?

**A:** No. It shows current market price, not predictions. Bitcoin price depends on supply/demand, macroeconomic factors, sentiment, and many variables AI can't reliably predict.

### Q: Can this help me trade Bitcoin?

**A:** It provides data for context, but doesn't execute trades. To trade, you'd need to use an exchange API (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance) with write permissions, which is a separate integration. This skill is read-only.

### Q: Why are fee estimates different from what I see elsewhere?

**A:** Mempool.space estimates based on current pool state. Different services use different algorithms. Actual fees depend on network congestion at the moment you broadcast. Use estimates as guidance, not guarantees.

### Q: What if Mempool.space is down?

**A:** The script returns an error. For production use, set `BITCOIN_API_URL` to a self-hosted Mempool instance or commercial provider with redundancy.

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Use custom Mempool instance (default: mempool.space)
export BITCOIN_API_URL="https://mempool.space/api"

# Optional: CoinGecko API key (for better rate limits on prices)
export COINGECKO_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

## Author Notes

This skill brings live Bitcoin blockchain data into Hermes without requiring credentials or API keys in chat. The design is simple:

1. **Query Mempool.space** (largest Bitcoin mempool tracker, free, no auth)
2. **Fetch price from CoinGecko** (optional, falls back to Mempool)
3. **Return data only** (never transact, never move funds)
4. **Keep everything public** (Bitcoin data is public by design)

This skill is **standalone and independent**. It has no knowledge of trading systems, wallets, or other downstream consumers. Other systems call this skill when they need blockchain data — the skill just provides the data and exits. Perfect for dashboards, monitoring systems, trading research, fee analysis, or anything else that needs live Bitcoin data.

For Hermes users new to Bitcoin:
- Bitcoin address = your public identifier (like an email, anyone can send you coins)
- Private key = your ownership proof (like a password, never share it)
- UTXO = unspent output (Bitcoin you can spend, coins are immutable until spent)
- sat/vB = satoshis per virtual byte (fee measurement, lower = cheaper)
- Mempool = waiting room for transactions (before they get mined into blocks)
- Block height = which block number is current (increments every ~10 minutes)

**Philosophy:** Bitcoin is global, open, and permissionless. Hermes should know its state without gatekeepers. This skill makes that possible.
